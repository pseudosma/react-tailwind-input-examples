# React Tailwind Inputs

These are several sandbox tests for debugging React inputs using Tailwind CSS cobbled together on a single page. These tests were leftovers and early versions of components  developed for a proprietary project that was canceled and these have been uploaded here for posterity.

The files include examples of how to override a browser's default Radio Button, Checkbox, and Range Slider inputs.
